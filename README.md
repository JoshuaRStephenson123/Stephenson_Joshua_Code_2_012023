# Stephenson_Joshua_Code_2_012023

This is my second web project. With this i have learnt to use BEM methodology to help structure the code and make it more readable and reusuable through out the project. This also has shown me how to manage my files and folders and root them to the correct path to make anchor tags and links work correctly to connect to other webpages.
From this I have also learnt to impliment SASS.
